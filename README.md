# opnsense-theme-adwaita
Custome theme, based on the default theme, but using blue-ish Adwaita based coloring

The theme is quite similar to the default one, but uses colors from the Adwaita template https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/main/named-colors.html



the .tar.xz package can be installed with:

    sudo pkg add https://github.com/Knogle/opnsense-theme-adwaita/releases/download/0.1/os-theme-adwaita-color-devel-0.1.tar.xz

after installation, a new dark theme should appear in System-General -> Theme




after changing the color scheme, force-reload the page in the browser **(Shift-F5)**

if you want to get rid of the package:

    sudo pkg delete -y os-theme-adwaita-color
